      <h2>About me</h2>
      <h3>As an aspiring web developer, I enjoys
        challenging my self to always
        improve in my professional life. I
        take criticism as a way of guidance
        and a chance to learn and correct
        my mistakes.
        Outside the professional world I am
        an adventurous person who enjoys
        camping, hiking and rock climbing.
        I also like watching cartoons and
        doing yoga.
