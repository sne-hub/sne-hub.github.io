                <p class="section-text">
                    I am an aspiring web developer, who enjoys challenging herself to always improve in her professional
                    life.
                    Who
                    takes
                    criticism as a way of guidance and a chance to learn and correct her mistakes.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Journey to web development</h2>
                <p class="section-text">
                    My journey to web development started in 2020 when I enrolled on data engineering through an online
                    institution. At first, I was just interested in coding, but then when I started with data
                    engineering I realised that it was more statistics than actual coding which is what I am interested
                    in. In 2021 while I was doing my research on web development and looking for institutions that offer
                    it, I came across Umuzi Academy and attended the boot camp, and that is what I am currently doing.

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Skills learnt to date</h2>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Since I began this journey, I have used Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as a code editor, with it I
                    have been able to code in javascript using javascript algorithms, as well as in HTML and CSS while
                    building this site. The version control software that I have used and still using to share my
                    codes and to collaborate with teams in projects are Git and GIT-HUB.</br>
                    </br>
                    I am still keen to learn more programming tools and frameworks such as JQuery, Node.js
                    and REACT.js. I am also interested in learning another language such as JAVA. Please view my <a

                    Prior to studying web development, I studied geology and that is where my love for the outdoors
                    started.
                    I now enjoy camping and hiking, so when I am not working, I go for a hike. If I'm indoors, I also
                    like
                    to relax with cartoons and yoga.
